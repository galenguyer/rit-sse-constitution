\section{Mission Statement}
The Society of Software Engineers (SSE) is a student organization dedicated to fostering academic and professional success. Its focus is on four fundamental pillars: mentoring, networking, projects, and events. Through these aspects, the Society strives to build relationships with all students, the department, other organizations, and the institute.

\section{Non-discrimination Policy}
It is the shared belief amongst members of the SSE that discrimination on the basis of sex, race, age, gender, sexual orientation/identity, personal preferences, or any other factor is not acceptable. The members of the Society commit to upholding tolerance and respect of all people regardless of their lifestyle or background.
