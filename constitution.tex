\section{Mission Statement}
The Society of Software Engineers (SSE) is a student organization dedicated to fostering academic and professional success. Its focus is on four fundamental pillars: mentoring, networking, projects, and events. Through these aspects, the Society strives to build relationships with all students, the department, other organizations, and the institute.

\section{Non-discrimination Policy}
It is the shared belief amongst members of the SSE that discrimination on the basis of sex, race, age, gender, sexual orientation/identity, personal preferences, or any other factor is not acceptable. The members of the Society commit to upholding tolerance and respect of all people regardless of their lifestyle or background.

\section{Code of Conduct}
As active members of the RIT community, advocates of software engineering, and future workers in the computing industry, the Society's members are expected to demonstrate the highest levels of personal and professional conduct.

At the core of all efforts as Society members, we will:

\begin{itemize}
\item Demonstrate civility, respect, decency and sensitivity towards our fellow members of the RIT \\ community.
\item Conduct ourselves with the highest standards of moral and ethical behavior. Such behavior includes taking responsibility for our own personal choices, decisions and academic and professional work.
\item Affirm through the daily demonstration of these ideals that RIT is a university devoted to the pursuit of knowledge and a free exchange of ideas in an open and respectful environment.
\end{itemize}

\section{Pillars of the Society}

The Pillars of the Society describe the organization's foremost priorities. The Pillars do not directly map to committees -- all actions taken by the Society should reflect these priorities and improve the Society within these areas.

The Pillars shall be valued equally, and are listed here in no particular order.

\subsection{Mentoring}
The Society shall promote the academic success of members of the RIT community, with a focus on material related to Software Engineering.

\subsection{Networking}
The Society shall maintain relationships with prospective employers, sponsors, students, alumni, and important members of the computing industry.

\subsection{Projects}
The Society shall provide students with the opportunity to improve their engineering and creative skills in a non-academic setting.

\subsection{Events}
The Society shall provide opportunities to promote friendship and fellowship within the organization.
